# calculator-js

This application is a calculator that takes in two values and does the necessary math operations when the user clicks on the respective button. Orginally, this calculator application was an assignment that was assigned to me during Road to Hire. I decided to refactor my code to create a more cleaner design. I built this calculator using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

## Built With
